Created these sample inputs so we can calibrate a wet-sedge
tundra type (CMT06) near Barrow.

The inputs were created on T.Carman's laptop using the new 
parallelized create_region_input.py script. Run time about 10 min.

The pixel offsets used were x:617 y:20. The inputs were made as
subsets of SNAP's AR4 data, for the cccma_cgcm3_1_sresa1b dataset.

Here was the command used:

        $ ./create_region_input.py --tag SouthBarrow --which all --xsize 10 --ysize 10 --xoff 617 --yoff 20 --years -1

And then modify the default run-mask to use pixel 9,9.
