Plotting 
##################

Plotting is a natural and essential step in the modelling process. There use
-cases and limitations are numerous and there is not a single silver bullet plotting
solution that is sure to work for you.

When working on or with plotting code, it is helpful to remember that problems
can arise in two overlapping spheres: capability and environment.

Capability refers to whether or not the analysis and visualisation you seek are
implemented in the code you are working with.

Environmental referes to whether the computing environment(s) you work with have
the approproate software, tools, hardware, etc to carry out the capabilities of
the code you are working with.
