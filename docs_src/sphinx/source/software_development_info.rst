Version Management
==================
The primary reasons for using a version management system for  ``dvmdostem`` are:

* To maintain a meaningful history of the codebase so that the provenance
  of the code is not in question.
* To facilitate the addition or modification of code by many developers.
* To maintain the ability to revert to or recover specific points in the 
  history of the codebase. This may be for the purpose of duplicating prior
  work, or to recover a lost behavior of the software, or both.

There are two (related) parts to fulfilling the above goals:

* Making the commits (file diffs) easy to read and understand.
* Having a strategy or pattern for bringing different lines of development
  together.

If the file diffs are unreadable or the lines of development are not brought 
together in an organized fashion, then the project history is harder to trust
which brings into question the provenance of the code, and makes it harder for
people to contribute.
